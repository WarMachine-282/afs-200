Step 1:

1. In your Week 3 folder, create a folder called ‘list’ for this assignment.
2. Create a list.py file
3. The list.py file should take a list, say for example this one: 
<!-- a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
In the list.py file, write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5. -->

  Step 2: 

1. In your Week 3 folder, create a folder called ‘tuple’ for this assignment.
2. Create a tuple.py file
3. The tuple.py file should includes list of numbers in it:
<!-- (1,2,3,4,5,6,7);  -->

1. In the tuple.py file, write a program according to following specifications
- Tuple 1 includes list of information of Robert
<!-- (name, surname, birth year, favorite movie and year, profession, birthplace) = Robert  -->

- Tuple 2 includes list of numbers in it
- We call the value for [0] in tuple and for tuple 2 we call the value between 1 and 4
- Run the code- It gives name Robert for first tuple while for second tuple it gives number (2,3 and 4)

Step 3:

1. In your Week 3 folder, create a folder called ‘join & split’ for this assignment.
2. Create a join&split.py file
3. In the tuple.py file, write a program according to following specifications
- csv = 'Eric,John,Michael,Terry,Graham:TerryG;Brian'
- friends_list = ['Exercise: fill me with names']
- print(friends_list)
- From the above fill a list(friend_list) properly with the names of all the friends. One per “slot”
- You may need to enter same command several times
- Use print() statements to work your way through the exercise.
